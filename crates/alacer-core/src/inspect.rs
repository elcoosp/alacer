//! The devtools observation seam (§13.3): the causal vocabulary the
//! inspector consumes, and the observer sink the pipeline notifies.
//!
//! Everything here is **dev-mode and opt-in**: an unset observer and a
//! disabled capture flag cost one branch per frame — the A7 idle contract
//! and the M1 overhead gate are unchanged. With them on, the seam answers
//! the Causality inspector's five questions from recorded truth:
//!
//! | Question | Answered by |
//! |---|---|
//! | "Why did this render?" | [`InspectEvent::Edge`] — reactive edge activations carrying the masks they queued, resolved into the frame's dirty set |
//! | "Who wrote this signal?" | [`InspectEvent::Write`] — provenance-tagged writes (`Flux::write`) |
//! | "Who subscribes to this signal?" | the flux's edge table (`Flux::edge_table`) — the binding registrations |
//! | "Why is this frame slow?" | [`FrameSummary::passes`] — the per-pass ledger with wall times |
//! | "What did this mask touch?" | [`FrameSummary::dirty`] — the mask heatmap: role, label, bounds, mask per dirty node |
